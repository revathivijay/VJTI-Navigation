# VJTI-Navigation
VJTI Navigation is a campus navigation system for the VJTI Campus. Alexa devices are placed at key-locations on the campus which will give you a voice-assisted as well as visual navigation guide to get to the requested destination from your current location. Inputs to the system are given to the Alexa (Echo) devices in the form of voice commands. On getting the desired destination, back-end logic fires up to calculate the shortest path to get to the destination from the point you're currently at. If the destination is too far, you're guided to the nearest Alexa device.
